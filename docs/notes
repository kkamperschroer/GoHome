--Notes--


Automator has
	Set of events it is waiting for triggers from
	Set of rules for the events
	Set of actions that run when a corresponding rule evaluates to true

Event Monitors have
	A pointer to a function to call when something fires
	Some kind of watcher -- something that polls the filesystem, the network, etc.
	A "last call" property which is the last time that function was called
	A "on change" property which is particular to that even (e.g. fire only on change)
	...

Actions have
	A set of instructions (code) that they will execute when told.
	Optionally a set of events to trigger

Process flow
	Automator starts
	automator starts the event monitors giving the automators "event fired" function
	events do their thing, calling the "event fired" function given to them if an event is fired
	the automator gets a call to "event fired"
	The automator evaluates all rules containing that event
	Whichever rules evaluate to true, automator fires their action(s)
